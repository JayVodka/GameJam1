## Introduction
GAME JAM (GAIDEN, SPEICAL EDITION, AND KNUCKLES) is a "Zelda-like" top down adventure game that places players into the role of a delivery girl turned reluctant hero who must save the kingdom and it's prince from the jealous witch [REDACTED] in order to complete her latest delivery.  

## Background
Heavily insipired by the Zelda style of games.  Created using the Unity Engine and with the help of assets from humble bundle's game development bundle.

## Description
	You take the role of the item shop delivery girl Sumaira, who is running late in her delivery of a gift to the soon to be married Prince of the Kingdom of [REDACTED], a magical spear bought from traveling adventurers said to bless the wielder with fortune.  The wedding is taking place at the palace, and adventurers, knights, and other important persons of the kingdom have all gathered there for the cermony.  As Sumaira arrives to the Palace, the wedding cermony has already started, and rushes to find a way to deliver the spear in time.  As Sumaira finds a roundabout way to observe the wedding, a dark figure bursts in through the doors of the room.  The dark witch, [REDACTED], has appeared!  Envious of the bride to be, and obssessed with the prince, [REDACTED] curses the entire palace, turning everyone but the Prince, and our hero Sumaira, to stone.  [REDACTED] then charms the Prince with a spell, causing the Prince to obey [REDACTED] without question.  
	Sumaira, seemly protected from the curse of stone by the magical spear she was delivering, finds all of great heroes of the kingdom have been turned to stone.  Even worse, no one is around to pay for the dilevery of the spear.  Realizing that no one is left to save the kingdom, Sumaira resolves to save the kingdom herself, as she always sees her deliveries through to completion.  Now, Sumaira must adventure around the kingdom, which is now facing new troubles due to the lack of adventurers, in order to find a way to break the dark witch's curse. 
	In this game, you play as the new adventurer Sumaira, in a top down "Zelda-like" adventure game.  Combat involves the use of your basic spear attack, your shield, and the various pieces of equipment, which you can weild in addition to your basic weapon.  You will be tasked with saving the kingdom by fighting various enemies, solving puzzles and problems, discovering new locations, and ultimately defeating the evil witch [REDACTED].  [MORE THINGS]

### KOBOLD/RATFOLK SUBSET
Small sword/spear ratfolk
Small projectile ratfolk
Armor slow attack ratfolk
Oversized weapon attack ratfolk
Fire attack ratfolk
Item hoarder ratfolk

### KOBOLD/RATFOK BOSS
Giant, Fatish ratfolk
Has armor protecting his belly, swings large sword for a telegraphed sweeping attack that deals (if using standard heart health system) .75 hearts of damage.  Sword attack should take up about 1/3 of the screen vertically, making an arc, and taking up about 2/3 of the screen centered horizontally.  Doesn't move much , only when neccessary to be in range of the player.  
Player tactic is to hit boss's armored belly with ball and chain, which will weaken the armor, the play will then shot an arrow through a brazier with fire to create a flaming arrow that will destory a section of armor, which the player can then attack the boss, locking him in a stun animation until he rolls backwards and retreats past the battle arena.  The ratfolk watching the fight will then fire arrows in patterens indicated with markers on the ground, which the player will need to dodge while other ratfolk work to repair the bosses armor.  
This gameplay loop will repeat until the third time the player attacks the boss's exposed belly, after which the boss will conciede and the player will be reward with a health power up and the key dungeon item.

### AREAS
Stone castle (area which could be the tutorial dungeon, if it is, the ball and chain will be located there, otherwise it will be located in the pre dungeon area)
Forest surrounding the castle path and town path
Town (Should have some residents, some houses, and the item shop/Sumaira's home, which should aslo include Sumaira's parents)
Path to Pre dungeon area (should transition from forest to rocky terrian)
Pre Dungeon area (should include some light puzzles, combat against a few different types of enemies, teach the player how to use the ball and chain, which is located here if we do not use the Stone Castle area)
Dungeon (Should be cavern/mine like area, use only kobold/ratfolk enemies, various puzzles involving all of the players equipment (spear, shield, ball and chain, and new crossbow), and should include optional treasures.)
